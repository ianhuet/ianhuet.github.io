# WIP - RealWorld Quality Engineering

#### TL;DR
> This is as an exercise in quality engineering. I'm going to take an existing project from it's currently functional state, setup a local development environment, a deployment pipeline, and bring it to a point where it is supported by a systematic test strategy, implemented across multiple layers.
