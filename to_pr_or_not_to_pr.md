# To PR or not to PR
Is that the most meaningful question

## TL;DR

Debate around the use of the "Pull Request" process is endless. For all the arguments against it I remain an advocate for using PRs. Reflecting on this position brought me to the [Ship / Show / Ask](https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html) adaptation of the PR approach. It offers an easily communicated middle-ground between CI & PRs. Yet, coming to this middle-ground served me to highlight how many factors outside the branching strategy debate this topic encompasses.

For many years PRs have been the only process I've worked with for team development work. A recent internal project initially followed that same trend. This served us well in terms of sharing knowledge as the project rapidly evolved. However, the development of the projects core functionality fell to an engineer who drove a 'merge now & figure out the issues later' approach.

I found this challenging for a variety of reasons. Not least because it flew in the face of what I'd come to consider the 'right' way. In response I looked for a counter argument.

and only later realising the dogmatic place I was coming from 


* habit challenged by claut
* reflect on process options, consider release tooling
* ship / show / ask
  - well honed review practice
  - disipline / responsibility mindset
  - documentation / knowledge sharing
  - team work / better PR practice
  - monitor via source control metrics

## Take aways

- Avoid holding onto dogmatic positions
- The best answer is specific to each team/organisation
- Periodically revisit any decision
- Align on balance between throughput & DevEx
